## How to get going

- Clone this repo
- Run `vagrant up`
- Open ssh connection to your virtual machine: `vagrant ssh`
- Upload project files to vagrant
- Go to project source folder `cd site/src`
- Activate Python's virtual env with `source env/bin/activate`
- Once virtual env is activated, install some Python packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Lastly, in `site/` -folder, run `composer install` to get all PHP dependencies installed



Now you should be good to go.
